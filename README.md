# AI Dev Setup

Battle-tested rules, templates, and workflow patterns for AI-assisted development. Agent-agnostic — works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, or any AI coding agent.

## Philosophy

These rules encode a specific development philosophy:

- **Spec-driven**: Plan before code. Write specs, validate them, then implement.
- **TDD by default**: Tests first for all non-trivial changes.
- **Sacred tests**: Never modify existing tests to make code pass. If tests break, the code is wrong.
- **Ship complete**: Build it now or cut scope explicitly. Never defer to "future work."
- **Fail-closed**: Missing auth = error, not silent bypass. Least privilege always.
- **Proof required**: Claims about correctness must be backed by tests, logs, or reproducible checks.
- **Append-only audit**: Event and audit log tables are immutable. Never UPDATE or DELETE.

## Quick Start

1. Read `INSTALL.md` for your specific agent
2. Copy `global-preferences.md` into your agent's global config location
3. Copy `rules/project.md` into your project and fill in the `<!-- CUSTOMIZE -->` sections
4. Copy additional `rules/` files as needed for your stack
5. Copy `workflows/` into your project — these are the actual prompts that drive the dev process
6. Copy `templates/` into your project for sprint planning and delegation
7. Read `REPO-STRUCTURE.md` for how to organize your project

## Customization

Files with `<!-- CUSTOMIZE -->` markers have sections you need to fill in for your specific project. Search for these markers and replace with your project's details.

Rules without customize markers are stack-agnostic and can be used as-is.

## Origin

Extracted from a production AI agent orchestration platform. Every rule exists because something went wrong without it.
